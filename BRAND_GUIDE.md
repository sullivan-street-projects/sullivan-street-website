# Sullivan Street Projects — Brand Style Guide

## 1. Brand Identity
**Sullivan Street Projects** is a fractional growth consultancy that bridges the gap between high-level strategy and tactical execution. We are "Marketing for Tomorrow's Billion-Dollar Brands."

*   **Core Promise:** AI-powered strategy, media, and execution. Faster growth, sharper focus, higher profit.
*   **Differentiation:** We are not a traditional agency. We are a "General Contractor" for marketing—embedding leadership, managing specialists, and owning outcomes.
*   **Personality:** Authoritative, Modern, Direct, Outcome Obsessed.

## 2. Voice & Tone
Our voice is that of a seasoned executive: confident, concise, and focused on the bottom line.

*   **Direct & Action-Oriented:** We don't use fluff. We focus on verbs: *build, execute, scale, convert.*
    *   *Yes:* "We cut through the chaos and focus on the only metric that matters—growth."
    *   *No:* "We help brands navigate the complex marketing landscape to find synergy."
*   **Business-First:** We speak the language of the C-Suite (P&L, unit economics, ROI), not just marketing jargon (impressions, buzz).
    *   *Key Phrase:* "We keep marketing in lockstep with your P&L."
*   **Forward-Looking:** We embrace the future (AI, automation) but ground it in timeless business principles.

## 3. Typography
We use a classic pairing of a serif headline font with a clean sans-serif body font. This creates a look that is both established and modern.

### Primary Typeface (Headlines)
*   **Font:** **Libre Baskerville**
*   **Usage:** Headlines, key statements, "Call to Action" links.
*   **Characteristics:** Traditional, editorial, authoritative.
*   **Weights:** Regular (400), Bold (700), Italic.

### Secondary Typeface (Body & UI)
*   **Font:** **Inter**
*   **Usage:** Body paragraphs, navigation, UI elements, labels.
*   **Characteristics:** Clean, neutral, highly legible.
*   **Weights:** Light (300), Regular (400), Medium (500), Semi-Bold (600), Bold (700).

## 4. Color Palette
A minimal, high-contrast palette designed to feel like premium printed stationery.

### Primary Colors
*   **Charcoal (Text/UI):** `#1a1a1a`
    *   Used for all primary text and headings. Softer than pure black for better readability.
*   **Paper (Background):** `#FAFAF8`
    *   A warm, off-white cream color. Provides a tactile, organic feel compared to sterile white.

### Secondary & Accent Colors
*   **Growth Green:** `#4ADE80`
    *   Used sparingly for "active" indicators (e.g., the pulsing dot in the navigation) or to highlight success metrics.
*   **Divider Grey:** `#e5e5e5`
    *   Used for subtle borders and dividers.
*   **Text Grey:** `#404040` / `#737373`
    *   Used for subheadlines, body text, and labels.

## 5. Visual Effects & Texture
*   **Grain Overlay:** A subtle SVG noise filter (`opacity: 0.04`) is applied over the entire site. This gives the digital interface a "physical" texture, reinforcing the "felt not seen" aesthetic.
*   **Focus/Blur:** We use a `blur` effect triggered by scroll position to direct user attention. Elements fade in and out of focus, mimicking the behavior of a camera lens.
*   **Motion:** Animations are smooth and physics-based (using `lenis` for scrolling). Transitions are deliberate, reinforcing a sense of weight and quality.

## 6. Layout Principles
*   **Whitespace:** Generous padding and margins (`py-24`, `py-32`) allow content to breathe.
*   **Center Alignment:** Key headlines and introductory text are often centered for impact.
*   **Grid:** A max-width container (`max-w-[1200px]`) keeps content readable on large screens.

## 7. Logo & Naming
*   **Name:** Sullivan Street Projects
*   **Short Name:** SSP (Internal use only, avoid in public copy if possible)
*   **Logo Text:** Rendered in `Libre Baskerville`, giving it a logotype feel without a graphical mark.
