# Sullivan Street Projects

## Company Overview
Sullivan Street Projects is a fractional growth consultancy based in New York. We bridge the gap between high-level strategy and tactical execution for brands scaling to $1B+. We operate not as a traditional agency, but as a "General Contractor" for marketing—embedding executive leadership, managing specialists, and owning P&L outcomes.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Fractional Growth Executive:** CMO/VP-level leadership embedded with your team.
- **Marketing General Contractor:** We manage the build (media, creative, analytics) so you don't have to.
- **Outcome Obsessed:** AI enabled strategy focused on revenue growth and unit economics.

## Services
1.  **Advisory (Strategic Guidance):** For founders who need a thought partner. We provide decision support on hiring, vendors, and positioning.
2.  **Strategy (Go-to-Market Design):** For teams ready to build the playbook. We audit capabilities, model unit economics, and deliver an execution roadmap.
3.  **Management (Growth Leadership):** For leaders who need outcome ownership. We build the team, manage the vendors, and own the P&L targets.
