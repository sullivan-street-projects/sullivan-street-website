## Intro
headline: It's Time To Make Marketing Work The Way You Work
body: Modern marketing is a mess. Too many platforms, vendors, and agencies. Too much noise, not enough signal. We cut through the chaos and focus on the only metric that matters—growth.

## About
headline: Building Tomorrow's Billion-Dollar Brands
paragraph-1: Yesterday's agencies aren't built for tomorrow's brands.
paragraph-2: They were designed for a world where humans did the heavy lifting. That world is fading. From media buying to content generation, AI is now embedded across the marketing value chain. The work that drives meaningful growth has shifted to orchestration—managing systems, aligning teams, and making decisions that tie back to your P&L.
paragraph-3: Sullivan Street Projects is the growth partner businesses call when they need more than point solutions and disconnected vendors. We look across your entire business, translate goals into a clear growth plan, and turn marketing from an expense into a managed investment tied to what you're actually trying to achieve.
paragraph-4: Whether you need advisory, strategy, or management—we meet you where you are. The marketing consultancy purpose built for tomorrow.
